  je_keju: "The Imperial Examination System"
  je_keju_reason: "Since Emperor Wen of the Sui Dynasty established the imperial examination system, successive Chinese dynasties have used it for selecting officials. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, the exams primarily tested the Four Books and Five Classics. Candidates were required to write rigid \"eight-legged essays\" strictly adhering to classical commentaries, without room for creative expression.\n\nAlthough this system cultivated a habit of diligent study among the Chinese, it stifled scholars' creativity and free will, leading to a lack of innovation in the country."
